    Placed amidst placid greenery, the Attur-Karkala parish has a rich history. The church
    oversees a school and an orphanage. Born in the 3rd century, St. Lawrence, believed to be a Spaniard,
    was an extraordinarily virtuous young man. This quality came to the notice of the future Pope Sixtus II,
    then the archdeacon of Rome. Under the tutelage of Sixtus, Lawrence studied the holy scriptures, and the maxims
    of Christian perfection.
