    <h2>History and Submersion</h2>
    <p>Built in 1860 for wealthy British estate owners, the church faced an unforeseen fate in 1960. The construction of the Hemavati Dam and Reservoir led to the abandonment of the church, submerging it underwater during the monsoon season. Despite its submerged state, the Shettihalli Church has become a popular tourist spot, attracting visitors who come to witness the spectacle, often referred to as The Submerged Church or The Floating Church.</p>

The first, between July and October, allows one to witness the church partially submerged in water. The second, between December and May, reveals the church grounds as the water level recedes.</p>
